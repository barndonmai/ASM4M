                        <h3>Reflection; the ending</h3>
                        <p>In my time of ASM4M, I was able to successfully create projects that I had envisioned from the beginning. Although by the end I did not have enough time to finish all of them, such as the original animation rotoscoping video, I am still proud of the work that I was able to accomplish through various programs from the Adobe suite such as Photoshop, Premiere, and Media Encoder. I also used Procreate to draw out every single frame individually for the rotoscoping project as well as my own self-taught coding skills to create this website as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Although in the end I was not able to create exactly what I wanted to due to time-constraints and the stress of university admissions along with the pain of working as hard as I could only to not get into my top choices, I am still satisfied with what I was able to accomplish along with the new skills that I learned on the way that will most likely be used for my career-path in the near future.</p>
