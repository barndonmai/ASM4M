                    <p1>This is the logo that I created for "Mai Designs". I went through a long planning phase because I wanted it to be what I initially envisioned. In the end, the final result left me feeling satisfied. I used Adobe Photoshop and Procreate to plan and create this image. For the planning phase, I went through creating countless rough drafts but they all didn’t feel “right” to me, until this one.</p1>

                    <p1>In this montage of a game called “Valorant”, a first-person shooter style game, I put together a lot of clips that I took back when I used to be very passionate about it. The clips themselves capture the joy that I felt during these in-game moments and at the time, I was also very into the song that was being played. With this project itself, it sparked an idea; what if I combined everything together? I tried to teach myself how to properly time beats and create smooth transitions, and then created this montage as a one minute reel of what playing the game used to feel like to me.</p1>
